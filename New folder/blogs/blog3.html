            "Reborn in a book" refers to a common trope in isekai or fantasy stories where the main character dies in their original world and is reincarnated or transported into a fictional world that they previously read about in a book. This narrative device often allows the protagonist to have foreknowledge of the events, characters, and plotlines in the book. The character is given a chance to live a new life in a different setting, armed with information about the world they've entered.
